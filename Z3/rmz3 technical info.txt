    08001994    beginning of main loop

        080019B6    start of inf. loop
        080019BC    end 1 of inf. loop (wait for VBLANK)
        080019C4    end 2 of inf. loop (wait for VCOUNT > A0)

        080019CC    branch to input check

    08001A6E    end of main loop

    08001A14    read input specifically for soft reset?
    
    080381D8    idk why this value is here
    
    080FE534    BIOS functions

    080FE6E2    cool branches

    08338D34    supposedly important pointer for damage (enemy defense??)
    0835E89C    Hitbox pointer for Zero hitbox
    0835E8B4    Hitbox pointer for Zero dash hitbox
    0835F0D0    Pointer for saber damage
    0835F134    Hitbox pointer for overhead saber 1
    08366278    DDP for intro cannon enemy
    08366290    DRP for intro cannon enemy
    
    0863D100    stage data seems to begin around here

-- RAM

    EWRAM
    
    02001EB0    pressed keys (halfword)
    020023B8    ROM pointer to current stage data - specifically for collision checking
    020023BC    some other ROM pointer to stage data?
    020023C0    some other ROM pointer to stage data?
    020023C4    some other ROM pointer to something else
    0202FE60    stage index (set before loading stage)
    02030B61    "game state" value (seemingly no debug menu available)
    02037D04    health
    0203193C    equipped chip (?)
    02037CB4    zero's x position in the stage
    02037CB8    zero's y position in the stage
    02037D60    previous x position
    02037D64    previous y position
    02037D22    equipped element
    02037D24    equipped chip (?)
    
    IWRAM

    030015C8    VCOUNT interrupt routine (executed when VCOUNT goes back to 0; after first HBLANK?)
    03037D14    cyber elf 1
    03037D15    cyber elf 2
    
    IORAM
    
    04000004    REG_DISPSTAT (2 bytes). Should be 0x28 during HDRAW, 0x29 during VBLANK, 0x2A during HBLANK, 0x2B during both blanks,
                0x2C when VCOUNT interrupt is raised/HDRAW, 0x2E when VCOUNT interrupt is raised/HBLANK.

    04000006    VCOUNT, should be 0xA1 (161) when it has drawn the whole screen. Will then continue to count up
                to 0xE3 (227) during VBLANK. Resets back to 0 after first HBLANK. (need to double check all this if necessary)

-- BREAKPOINTS

    Note that "cursor" = line highlighted in blue (i.e. just whatever line you click on)

    [02001EB0]! break on button press
    [02001EB0]? break on button read
    [03005928]! break on write to enemy hp #1
    [04000130]? break on ioram button read
    $, [04000130] != 0x03FF break at cursor if button pressed
    08001A2E    break on soft reset (don't press B last)
    08007B1A    break on damage calculation
    [06014800]? break on tile read for "boss beaten" icon on stage select
    $, r0 = 0006C4FF break when standing on the ground at beginning of intro stage (cursor at 08026034)
    

-- SUBROUTINES

    SOFTRESET:  08001A12 - 1A4C
        08001A14 - 1A1C checks start+select, 08001A1E - 1A26 checks A, 08001A28 - 1A30 checks B
        if true, sets r0 to #0x0 and jumps to 08002388

    KEY: 0800312C
        see z3prac_subr_key

-- VARIOUS

    Hitbox pointers: +0x14 for width, +0x16 for height

    damage: ENEMY DAMAGE POINTER (IWRAM ~338C) -> ENEMY DAMAGE VALUE (ROM ~365F18) -> STORED IN IWRAM (IWRAM ~592F)
    
    ORDER OF BUTTONS: A B Select Start Right Left Up Down R L

    DAMAGE DEALING POINTER (DDP) always(?) followed by DAMAGE RECEIVING POINTER (DRP). Length of 1 chunk = 0x18
    DDP + 0x03 = damage dealt (for enemies only?)
    DRP + 0x02 = something if 0x01, see instructions 0800761C - 08007620 (+ some more after)
    DRP + 0x08 = invincibility if 0xFF (and 0x00?), see instructions 080075DC - 080075E0

    In damage calculation subroutine, branch to 0x08007602 = 0 damage, see ya

    Saber damage sequence: 08 08 08 06 0A 08 08 08 10 10 10 10 0A 0A 0E 0E 0E 0E 0C 0C 04 06 10 10 00 01 02 03
    Offsets are stored in EWRAM, but where do they come from??

    Hitbox types: i guess i was intending to write something here
