# How to Patch
You'll need the ROM patcher, Asar (you can find it [here](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&s=tools)), and a headered SMW (U) ROM (513kB).
1. Click the big green "Clone or download" button and select zip file.
2. Unzip that somewhere, and stick both asar.exe and your SMW ROM in the folder with PATCH.bat.
3. Rename your ROM to "SMW.smc" and run the bat file. The patched ROM will be called "patched.smc."
4. You can rename that and run that and put it on your SD card.
