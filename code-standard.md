- The subroutine calling convention used in GBA games is that registers **r0-r3** are input registers which are _not_ preserved upon return; **r4-r10** are preserved (i.e. they are pushed on the stack for the duration of the subroutine if they are used within said subroutine, otherwise untouched). If more than four input parameters are needed for a subroutine, they should be pushed on the stack.
- All subroutines and data definitions _must_ have proper comments in order to keep the code comprehensible. Subroutine comments should describe what the subroutine does and detail eventual input/output parameters.
